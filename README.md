💡 Project Overview

We just got back from a hackathon... and boom 💥
End-term hits us with project files, writeups, viva prep, and DBMS submissions — sab ek saath.

And like true engineers, we did what we do best —
Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V first... and then actually built something cool. 😅

That’s how DukaanLy was born — a smart inventory management system designed for local shopkeepers to prevent losses due to expired goods and overstocking during festivals.

This idea hit home — literally.
My dad runs stores, and I’ve seen how expired goods or festival overstock can cause massive losses.
So we built something that helps small business owners take control of their stock — easily, affordably, and smartly.

✨ Core Features

💫 Journey So Far

Last year, during our UHV activities, we interacted with local shopkeepers and discovered the recurring problem of expired goods and festival overstocking.
We pitched a basic app idea just to earn marks for our presentation 😅...

Fast forward a year — while building this project for our DBMS course, it hit us:

“Wait… we actually made the same app we once pretended to design for UHV!”

Destiny? Maybe.
But definitely, engineering magic + caffeine. ☕

🙏 Acknowledgment

A sincere note of gratitude to our course instructor,
Dr. Nitin Bhopale Sir,
for his invaluable guidance, encouragement, and thoughtful feedback throughout this journey.
His mentorship transformed our project from files to a functional product.
